## Notes
* Cases are ordered from PCBWAY with their [UTR-8100 transparent resin](https://www.pcbway.com/rapid-prototyping/3d-printing/plastic/resin/UTR-8100/).
* The shim holds the circuit board securely in place within in the case, and also holds the artwork against the case window. It can be 3D printed / milled from any rigid material. (I use FDM-printed PETG)
